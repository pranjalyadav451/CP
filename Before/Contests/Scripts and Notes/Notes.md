## Learnings
- Never start the problme unless you have the logic and implementation details clear.
- Figure out the logic, find the correct data structure to implement it.
- I have pretty fast typing speed, and I can code anything in at most 10 minutes.
- Dry run for the test cases.
- Take at the least half of the time you took to find logic and implementation to look for edge cases.
- Code it out.

## Basic things
- Be ready 30 minutes before the contest.
- Don't use your phone when you are attempting the contest.
- Don't care about other people's submissions, you would not get better by getting
depressed over looking at their accepted solutions. That would just make you more anxious.
- Always have a notebook and pen ready
- Be hydrated
- Be Fresh
- Be calm
- I have observed, whenever I am calm I am more focussed and more efficient in solving problems
and even if I don't solve the problems at least I don't get overwhelmed by the situation.
