# What I learnt
- Read the questions well
- Give the constraints very high priority
    - Because these are the things that decide the whole flow
    of the solution
    - Worst Case => Upper Limit of Individual testcases)*(Number of test cases.)
    -If the number of operations in worst case >= 1e9 -> You have to optimize the solution because this will exceed the time limit and try to find the patters in the solution that will help you achieve the goal of optimizing the solution.
- For maths problems treat them like maths problem first then only as programming questions because most of the times the solution is in the maths of the solution rather rather than in the programming part.
