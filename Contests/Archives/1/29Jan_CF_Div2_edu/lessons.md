# For Number Problems
- check as many edge cases as possible 
- some edge cases include
    - first_num = second_num
    - first_num > second_num
    - second_num > first_num
    - both the numbers are at the upper and lower limits of their constraints
    - in divison type questions check if first_num % second_num =0 or second_num %first_num=0 in each case (for each combination of the upper edge cases)
