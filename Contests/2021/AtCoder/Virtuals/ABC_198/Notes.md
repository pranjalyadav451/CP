##  `Div`
    - Very Easy, As usual
    - In trying to speedforce this, I messed up the logic.
    - Items are indistinguishable - same.

## `Palindrome with leading zeros`
    - Basic Implementation Problem related to Palindromes

## `Compass walking` 
    - Only one edge case did WA two times.
    - Edge Case - When (Radius > Distance to be covered), ==> Steps = 2
## `Send More Money (Not Completed)`
    - Brute Force with some conditions
    - Have to improve my implementation logic and speed of Brute force Problems
